Disable v6-wplt iframe to prevent unnecessary resource consumption

The player is designed to download channel metadata and assets for use
by a separate rendering service. The v6-wplt iframe was loading and
consuming resources (memory, CPU, network) without being used.

Changes:
- Disabled CPWebFrame iframe in ShimApp.tsx (commented out)
- Updated README.md to clarify player does not render content
- Updated SIMPLIFIED-README.md to reflect iframe is disabled
- Removed references to "Channel URL Display" feature
- Added note about separate rendering service

This reduces resource usage significantly as v6-wplt and all its
dependencies (Segment analytics, content assets, etc.) no longer load.

The player now only:
- Activates device via MQTT
- Downloads channel metadata and assets to disk
- Provides device management UI (menu)
- Stores files at: C:\Users\Public\Documents\Four Winds Interactive\Content\
